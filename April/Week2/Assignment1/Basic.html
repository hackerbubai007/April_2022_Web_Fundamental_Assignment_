        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScrip</p>
        <p><b>Attributes:</b> HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type.</p>
        <p>An HTML element is a type of HTML document component, one of several types of HTML nodes. HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document. Each element can have HTML attributes specified. </p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Types of CSS: Inline, External and Internal. The main difference between inline CSS and external CSS is that inline CSS is processed faster as it only requires the browser to download 1 file while using external CSS will require downloading HTML and CSS files separately. </p>
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>
        <p><h>Javascript Features:</h> 1. Light Weight Scripting Language 路 2. Dynamic Typing 路 3. Object-Oriented Programming Support 路 3. Functional Style 路 4. Platform Independent.
        </p>
        <p><b>Advantages:</b> JavaScript is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of the web pages, whose implementation allows a client-side script to interact with a user and to make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
        <p><b>Disadvantages:</b> The main problem in JavaScript is that the code is always visible to everyone anyone can view JavaScript code. No matter what proportion fast JavaScript interpret, JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) is slow and can be a never fast rendering with HTML.</p>
